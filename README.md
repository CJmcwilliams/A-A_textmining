Acquire and Analyze for Text Mining

I will be analyzing the sentiment of an NFL team's hashtag during the course of a game.
I chose to use #Ravens for the Baltimore Ravens.

The plot of sentiment scores will be compared to game flow and the real-time win probability chart from ESPN.

Really? As I write this is it 5:31 PM MST and 12:31 UTC. That makes it seem like _UTC_ is _seven_ hours 
ahead of MST. Makes me nervous that your game start/end are wrong.  
You included the test code I wrote, which you don't need to do. Edit your code down
to just what is needed. 

The write-up and analysis is great. I like the way you used the ESPN plots. 

Here's my request: go make sure you did the time/date stuff correctly. If you did, this 
assignment is complete. If not, fix it and re-run. You don't have to re-do all your interpretation,
since I know that was pretty lengthy, but I'd like to make really sure we have the right tweets in the analysis.
